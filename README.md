# Redbarn Template Engine
Redbarn is a server side HTML view engine for JEE based projects.  What makes
Redbarn slightly different from other view engine technologies is that its model
binding / runtime syntax is JavaScript and sports a lightweight version of
jQuery to boot.  The upside to this approach for full stack web developers is
that model binding syntax is familiar.

## Building
- Clone the project
- Issue `mvn clean install`

## Testing
To run the tests, simply issue `mvn test`.
